<p><h3><b>What is HTML?</b></h3>

HTML is Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the basis of most of the documents on the web. HTML documents contain text content, which is text you see when you are looking at the web page, and markup, which is the instructions for how the text should be displayed on the webpage.
</p>
<p> <H3>HTML is an Important Part of How the Internet Works </h3>

When you use your computer to go to a website, your computer uses something called Hyptertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP to send requests to servers. These servers respond by finding the appropriate HTML documents, and you see the web page you requested when you clicked a link or entered a URL.
Your browser reads and interprets the HTML and displays the web page. </p>
<p>
<h3>HTML Markup Basics </h3> 

<b>Tags:</b> These are basically instructions inserted into the HTML document that give directions on how it should be formatted. Usually these instructions  or elements have both an an opening or closing tag. The exception is void tags, which have no content and so don’t need a closing tag. If a tag is not void, it needs a closing tag, or whatever instruction the tag gives won't stop.

<b>Elements:</b> Individual components of HMTL documents.  Elements are either inline or block.  Block elements have a sort of “box” around them that allows you to write code with instructions on style. For example, you can set height and width.
</p>
  <b>Attributes:</b> These are properties or values of an HTML element that modify it. 
For example, "href" is the attribute that tells the browswer that the text content of the element should be <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website"> a live link to a website. </a> </p>
<p> <h2><b>Handy Tips!</b> </h2>
<b>Computers are Stupid:</b>
You use HTML to tell the computer what to do. If you aren’t exact with your syntax, the computer will get confused about what you're telling it to do. Basically, your code won’t work.</p>
<p>

<b>You don’t have to memorize everything right now:</b>
Right now, it’s more important to understand the underlying concepts than to memorize every tag, as you can always look up specific tags if you understand the concept behind what you’re trying to do.
